## What is ThreeDoors?

ThreeDoors is a **radical rethinking of task management** that reduces decision friction by showing you only **three tasks at a time**. Instead of overwhelming you with an endless list, ThreeDoors presents three carefully selected "doors" — choose one, take action, and move forward.

### The Problem

Traditional task lists create **choice paralysis**. Staring at 50+ tasks makes it hard to start anything. You spend more time reorganizing and re-prioritizing than actually doing the work.

### The ThreeDoors Solution

- **Three doors, one choice** — Reduces cognitive load by limiting options
- **Refresh when needed** — Don't like your options? Roll again
- **Quick search** — Press `/` to find something specific
- **Mood-aware tracking** — Log your emotional state to understand work patterns
- **Pattern learning** — Over time, learn which tasks you avoid and why
- **Avoidance detection** — Automatically surfaces tasks you keep skipping
- **Values alignment** — Keep your goals front-and-center while working

## Features

### Core Task Management
- 🚪 **Three Doors Display** — View three randomly selected tasks, avoiding recently shown ones
- 🔄 **Refresh Mechanism** — Re-roll doors when nothing appeals
- ✅ **Task Status Workflow** — Complete, block, defer, expand, fork, or flag tasks for rework
- ➕ **Quick Add** — Add tasks inline with `:add` or press `a`; supports context capture with `:add --why`
- 🏷️ **Inline Tagging** — Tag tasks as you add them: `Design homepage #creative #deep-work @work`
- 📂 **Task Categorization** — Classify by type (creative, technical, administrative, physical), effort (quick-win, medium, deep-work), and location (home, work, errands, anywhere)
- 🔗 **Cross-Reference Linking** — Link related tasks together; browse and navigate links from detail view

### Search & Commands
- 🔍 **Quick Search** — Press `/` for live task search with fuzzy filtering
- ⌨️ **Command Palette** — Press `:` for vi-style commands (`:add`, `:mood`, `:stats`, `:health`, `:dashboard`, `:goals`, `:help`)

### Analytics & Insights
- 📊 **Session Metrics** — Automatic tracking of door selections, bypasses, and timing data
- 📈 **Daily Completion Tracking** — Track completions per day with streak counting
- 📋 **Insights Dashboard** — View trends, streaks, mood correlations, and avoidance patterns (`:dashboard`)
- 😊 **Mood Correlation Analysis** — Discover how your emotional state affects task selection
- 🚨 **Avoidance Detection** — Tasks bypassed 10+ times trigger an intervention prompt offering breakdown, deferral, or archival
- 🧠 **Pattern Analysis** — Identifies door position bias, task type preferences, and procrastination patterns

### Apple Notes Integration
- 🍎 **Bidirectional Sync** — Read and write tasks from Apple Notes
- 🔌 **Provider Architecture** — Switch between text file and Apple Notes backends via `config.yaml`
- 🩺 **Health Check** — Run `:health` to verify provider connectivity, file access, and disk space

### Sync & Offline-First
- 💾 **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** — Crash-safe task persistence with atomic writes
- 📡 **Offline Queue** — Local change queue with replay when connectivity returns
- 🔄 **Sync Status Indicator** — Visual sync state per provider in the TUI

### Calendar Awareness
- 📅 **Local Calendar Reader** — Reads from macOS Calendar.app (AppleScript), `.ics` files, and CalDAV caches
- ⏰ **Free Block Detection** — Computes available time blocks between calendar events

### Enrichment Database
- 🗃️ **SQLite Storage** — Pure-Go SQLite (no CGO) for task metadata, cross-references, learning patterns, and feedback history
- 🕸️ **Cross-Reference Graph** — Track relationships between tasks across providers

### LLM Task Decomposition (Spike)
- 🤖 **Task Breakdown** — Decompose complex tasks into stories using Claude or local Ollama
- 📝 **Git Integration** — Write generated story specs directly to git repos

### User Experience
- 👋 **First-Run Onboarding** — Guided welcome flow with keybinding tutorial, values/goals setup, and optional task import
- 🎯 **Values & Goals Display** — Persistent footer showing your values as you work
- 😊 **Mood Logging** — Capture emotional state anytime with presets or custom text
- 💬 **Door Feedback** — Rate doors as blocked, not-now, or needs-breakdown to improve selection
- 💡 **Session Improvement Prompt** — On quit, optionally share improvement suggestions
- ➡️ **Contextual Next Steps** — After completing or adding a task, see relevant next actions

### Distribution
- 🍺 **Homebrew** — Install via `brew install arcaven/tap/threedoors`
- 🔏 **Signed & Notarized** — macOS binaries are code-signed and Apple-notarized
- 💻 **Cross-Platform Binaries** — Pre-built for macOS (ARM & Intel) and Linux (x86_64)
- 🚀 **GitHub Releases** — Automatic releases on every merge to main

### Make Targets

```bash
make build          # Build the application
make run            # Build and run
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run golangci-lint

### Code Style

We use `gofumpt` (stricter than `gofmt`) and `golangci-lint`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full coding standards.

```bash
make fmt    # Format code
make lint   # Run linter (must pass with zero warnings)
```

## Philosophy

1. **Progress Over Perfection** — Taking action on imperfect tasks beats perfect planning
2. **Reduce Friction** — Every interaction should feel effortless
3. **Learn from Behavior** — Track patterns to help users understand their work habits
4. **Emotional Context Matters** — Mood affects productivity; acknowledge and track it
5. **Power Users Welcome** — Vi-style commands without sacrificing simplicity
6. **Local-First** — Your data stays on your machine, no accounts, no telemetry

## Data & Privacy

- **All data is local** — Stored in `~/.threedoors/`
- **No telemetry** — Session metrics stay on your machine
- **No accounts** — No sign-ups, no servers, no tracking
- **Offline-first** — Works without network; syncs when available
