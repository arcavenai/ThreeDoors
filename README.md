## What is ThreeDoors?

ThreeDoors is a **radical rethinking of task management** that reduces decision friction by showing you only **three tasks at a time**. Instead of overwhelming you with an endless list, ThreeDoors presents three carefully selected "doors"—choose one, take action, and move forward. It's built on the philosophy that **progress over perfection** matters more than perfect planning.

### The Problem

Traditional task lists create **choice paralysis**. Staring at 50+ tasks makes it hard to start anything. You spend more time reorganizing and re-prioritizing than actually doing the work.

### The ThreeDoors Solution

- **Three doors, one choice** - Reduces cognitive load by limiting options
- **Refresh when needed** - Don't like your options? Roll again (press `s`)
- **Quick search** - Need something specific? Press `/` to search
- **Mood-aware tracking** - Log your emotional state to understand work patterns
- **Pattern learning** - Over time, learn which tasks you avoid and why

## Project Status

**Phase:** Technical Demo & Validation (Epic 1)
**Current Milestone:** Story 1.2 - Display Three Doors from Task File
**Goal:** Build and validate core Three Doors UX concept within 1 week

## Features

### Core Functionality
- 🚪 **Three Doors Display** - View three randomly selected tasks at once

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binary

Pre-built binaries are available as CI artifacts for each push to `main`. Download the appropriate binary for your platform:

| Platform | Binary |
|----------|--------|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `threedoors-darwin-arm64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `threedoors-darwin-amd64` |
| Linux (x86_64) | `threedoors-linux-amd64` |

To download, go to [Actions](https://github.com/arcaven/ThreeDoors/actions) on GitHub, select the latest successful workflow run, and download the `threedoors-binaries` artifact.

```bash
# Make the binary executable and move it to your PATH
chmod +x threedoors-*
mv threedoors-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/threedoors   # adjust for your platform
```

### Option 2: Install with `go install`

```bash
go install github.com/arcaven/ThreeDoors/cmd/threedoors@latest
```

This places the `threedoors` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin` by default).

### Option 3: Build from Source

**Prerequisites:**
* **Go** 1.25.4 or higher ([installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install))
* **Git**
* **Make** (optional, for build automation)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arcaven/ThreeDoors.git
cd ThreeDoors
make build
# or without Make:
go build -o bin/threedoors ./cmd/threedoors
```

The binary will be at `bin/threedoors` (or wherever you specified with `-o`).

### Usage

1. **Launch** the app:
   ```bash
   threedoors
   ```
2. **First run** creates `~/.threedoors/tasks.txt` with sample tasks.
3. **Add your tasks** by editing `~/.threedoors/tasks.txt` (one task per line).
4. **Select a door** with `a` (left), `w` (center), or `d` (right) to view task details.
5. **Re-roll** doors with `s` if nothing appeals.
6. **Act on a task** using status keys: `c` (complete), `b` (blocked), `i` (in progress), `e` (expand), `f` (fork), `p` (procrastinate).
7. **Log your mood** with `m`.
8. **Search** with `/` to find a specific task.
9. **Quit** with `q` or `Ctrl+C`.

### Data Directory (`~/.threedoors/`)

ThreeDoors stores all data locally in `~/.threedoors/`:

```
~/.threedoors/
├── tasks.txt          # Active tasks (one per line)
├── completed.txt      # Tasks marked as complete
└── sessions.jsonl     # Session metrics (JSON Lines format)
```

- **`tasks.txt`** — Your active task list. Edit this file directly to add, remove, or reorder tasks.
- **`completed.txt`** — Tasks that have been marked complete are moved here automatically.
- **`sessions.jsonl`** — Records of each session including door selections, bypasses, mood logs, and timing data. Each line is a self-contained JSON object.

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
# or
go test ./...
```

### Code Style and Linting

We use `gofumpt` (stricter than `go fmt`) and `golangci-lint`:

```bash
# Format code
gofumpt -w .

# Run linter
golangci-lint run ./...

# Or use Make targets
make lint
make fmt
```

### Make Targets

```bash
make build    # Build the application
make run      # Run the application
make test     # Run tests
make clean    # Remove build artifacts
make lint     # Run linter
make fmt      # Format code
```

## Philosophy & Design Principles

ThreeDoors is built on several core principles:

1. **Progress Over Perfection** - Taking action on imperfect tasks beats perfect planning
2. **Reduce Friction** - Every interaction should feel effortless and natural
3. **Learn from Behavior** - Track patterns to help users understand their work habits
4. **Emotional Context Matters** - Mood affects productivity; acknowledge and track it
5. **Power Users Welcome** - Vi-style commands for efficiency without sacrificing simplicity
6. **Local-First** - Your data stays on your machine (`~/.threedoors/`)

## Data & Privacy

- **All data is local** - Tasks stored in `~/.threedoors/tasks.txt`
- **No telemetry** - Session metrics stay on your machine (`~/.threedoors/sessions.jsonl`)
- **No accounts** - No sign-ups, no servers, no tracking
- **Plain text** - Your tasks are readable and portable

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2: Apple Notes Integration (Post-Validation)
- Sync tasks with Apple Notes
- Bidirectional updates (edit in Notes or ThreeDoors)
- iCloud sync across devices

### Phase 3: Enhanced Interaction & Learning
- Interactive prompts and guidance
- Values and goals display
- Daily completion tracking
- Continuous improvement prompts

### Phase 4: Intelligent Door Selection
- **Mood correlation analysis** - "When stressed, you avoid complex tasks"
- **Pattern recognition** - Identify tasks you consistently skip
- **Adaptive selection** - Show appropriate tasks based on current mood
- **Goal re-evaluation** - Prompt when persistent avoidance detected
