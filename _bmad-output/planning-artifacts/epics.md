## Epic 3.5: Platform Readiness & Technical Debt Resolution (Bridging)

**Epic Goal:** Refactor core architecture, harden adapters, establish test infrastructure, and resolve technical debt from rapid Epic 1-3 implementation. This bridging epic prepares the codebase for Epic 4+ work by establishing the architectural foundations specified in Architecture v2.0.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 3 complete ✅
**Blocks:** Epic 4 (stories 3.5.5, 3.5.6), Epic 7 (stories 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3), Epic 9 (story 3.5.7), Epic 11 (story 3.5.4)
**Origin:** Party mode bridging discussion (2026-03-02)

### Story 3.5.1: Core Domain Extraction

As a developer,
I want `internal/tasks` split into `internal/core` (domain logic) and separate adapter packages,
So that the architecture follows the five-layer design specified in Architecture v2.0 and enables the Plugin SDK (Epic 7).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current `internal/tasks/` package with ~2,100 LOC across 12 files
**When** the refactoring is complete
**Then** `internal/core/` contains: TaskPool, DoorSelector, StatusManager, SessionTracker (domain logic only)
**And** `internal/adapters/textfile/` contains the YAML file adapter (extracted from FileManager)
**And** `internal/adapters/applenotes/` contains the Apple Notes adapter
**And** `internal/tui/` depends only on `internal/core/`, not on adapter implementations (dependency inversion)
**And** all existing tests pass without modification (behavior-preserving refactor)
**And** no user-facing behavior changes

### Story 3.5.2: TaskProvider Interface Hardening

As a developer building future integrations,
I want the TaskProvider interface formalized with Watch(), HealthCheck(), and ChangeEvent patterns,
So that the adapter SDK (Epic 7) has a stable, well-defined contract.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current TaskProvider interface from Epic 2
**When** hardening is complete
**Then** `TaskProvider` interface includes: Name(), Load(), Save(), Delete(), Watch(), HealthCheck() methods
**And** `ChangeEvent` struct defined with Type (Created/Updated/Deleted), TaskID, Task, Source fields
**And** contract test stubs created in `internal/adapters/contract_test.go` (placeholder for Epic 9)
**And** existing text file and Apple Notes adapters updated to implement the hardened interface
**And** interface documented with godoc comments

### Story 3.5.3: Config.yaml Schema & Migration Spike

As a developer,
I want a spike on config.yaml schema design and migration path,
So that Epic 7's config-driven provider selection has a validated foundation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current scattered configuration (hardcoded paths, text files)
**When** the spike is complete
**Then** `docs/spikes/config-schema.md` documents: proposed config.yaml schema, provider section design, migration path from current config
**And** spike verifies zero-friction upgrade: existing users without config.yaml default to current behavior (text file provider)
**And** sample config.yaml drafted with commented provider examples
**And** spike identifies any breaking changes and mitigation strategies

### Story 3.5.4: Apple Notes Adapter Hardening

As a user relying on Apple Notes sync,
I want the adapter to handle errors gracefully with timeouts and retries,
So that sync is reliable before more adapters are added.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current Apple Notes adapter using os/exec for AppleScript
**When** hardening is complete
**Then** all AppleScript calls have configurable timeout (default: 10s)
**And** transient failures retry with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
**And** errors are categorized: transient (retry), permanent (fail fast), configuration (user action needed)
**And** error messages are user-friendly and actionable
**And** adapter logs sync operations for debugging (respects NFR9 - no sensitive data)

### Story 3.5.5: Baseline Regression Test Suite

As a developer preparing for Epic 4 (Learning),
I want baseline tests for the current door selection and task management behavior,
So that the learning engine (Epic 4) can be validated against known-good behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current random door selection algorithm
**When** baseline tests are created
**Then** table-driven tests cover: random selection from pool, Fisher-Yates diversity, recently-shown ring buffer exclusion, empty/small pool edge cases
**And** status management tests cover: all valid state transitions, invalid transition rejection, completion flow
**And** task pool tests cover: load, filter by status, add, remove, update operations
**And** tests serve as regression suite when Epic 4 modifies selection algorithm
**And** all tests pass on current codebase

### Story 3.5.6: Session Metrics Reader Library

As a developer building Epic 4 (Learning),
I want a reusable library for reading and parsing session metrics,
So that Epic 4 stories can focus on learning logic rather than I/O.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** session metrics stored in `~/.threedoors/sessions.jsonl`
**When** the reader library is created
**Then** `internal/core/metrics/reader.go` provides: ReadAll(), ReadSince(time), ReadLast(n) methods
**And** each method returns typed `SessionMetrics` structs (not raw JSON)
**And** handles corrupted/malformed lines gracefully (skip with warning, don't fail)
**And** unit tests cover: empty file, single session, multiple sessions, corrupted lines
**And** library is dependency-free (no external packages beyond stdlib)

### Story 3.5.7: Adapter Test Scaffolding & CI Coverage Floor

As a developer,
I want test infrastructure scaffolding and CI coverage enforcement,
So that Epic 9 (Testing Strategy) has a foundation and coverage doesn't erode.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the current CI pipeline without coverage enforcement
**When** scaffolding is complete
**Then** test fixture directory `testdata/` created with sample data for adapter testing
**And** mock/stub helpers created in `internal/testing/` for common test patterns
**And** CI pipeline updated to measure coverage (`go test -coverprofile`) and fail if below threshold (set to current level)
**And** coverage report posted as PR comment
**And** `internal/adapters/contract_test.go` scaffolding ready for Epic 9 to fill

### Story 3.5.8: Validation Gate Decision Documentation

As the product team,
I want the Phase 1 validation results formally documented,
So that the proceed-to-MVP decision is recorded and learnings inform Epic 4.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** Phase 1 (Technical Demo) has been used daily
**When** documentation is complete
**Then** `docs/validation-gate-results.md` documents: validation period, usage patterns, friction reduction evidence from session metrics
**And** UX lessons learned captured (what worked, what surprised, what to improve)
**And** formal "proceed to MVP" decision recorded with rationale
**And** recommendations for Epic 4 learning algorithm based on observed patterns
**And** document references actual session metrics data as evidence

---

## Epic 4: Learning & Intelligent Door Selection

**Epic Goal:** Use historical session metrics (captured in Epic 1 Story 1.5) to analyze user patterns and adapt door selection to improve task engagement and completion rates.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 3 complete ✅, sufficient usage data collected
**FRs covered:** FR20, FR21

### Story 4.1: Task Categorization & Tagging

As a user,
I want my tasks automatically categorized by type, effort, and context,
So that the system can present diverse door selections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a task pool with uncategorized tasks
**When** the categorization engine processes them
**Then** each task receives type (creative, administrative, technical, physical), effort (quick-win, medium, deep-work), and context (home, work, errands) labels
**And** categorization is heuristic-based (keyword matching, task text analysis) without requiring user input
**And** users can override or correct auto-categorization via `:tag` command
**And** categories are persisted in task metadata (YAML)

### Story 4.2: Session Metrics Pattern Analysis

As a developer,
I want to analyze historical session metrics for user behavior patterns,
So that the learning engine has data to work with.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** accumulated session metrics in sessions.jsonl
**When** the pattern analyzer runs
**Then** it identifies: door position preferences (left/center/right bias), task type selection vs bypass rates, time-of-day patterns, mood-task correlation coefficients, and avoidance patterns (tasks shown 3+ times without selection)
**And** results are stored in a patterns cache file (patterns.json)
**And** analysis runs on app startup (background, non-blocking)
**And** minimum 5 sessions required before generating patterns (cold start guard)

### Story 4.3: Mood-Aware Adaptive Door Selection

As a user,
I want door selection to consider my current mood and historical patterns,
So that I'm shown tasks that match my current capacity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has logged a mood entry (or has recent mood history)
**When** doors are selected for display
**Then** the selection algorithm weights tasks based on mood-task correlation data (e.g., "stressed" → prefer quick-wins over deep-work)
**And** the algorithm still includes diversity (not all doors match mood preference)
**And** if no mood data exists, falls back to random selection (current behavior)
**And** selection weights are configurable in a learning config section

### Story 4.4: Avoidance Detection & User Insights

As a user,
I want to be gently informed about my avoidance patterns,
So that I can make conscious decisions about deferred tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a task has been shown in doors 5+ times without selection
**When** that task appears in doors again
**Then** a subtle indicator appears (e.g., "You've seen this task 7 times")
**And** the system does NOT nag or guilt — framing is informational
**And** a `:insights` command shows a summary of patterns ("When stressed, you avoid technical tasks")
**And** persistent avoidance (10+ bypasses) triggers a gentle prompt: "This task keeps appearing. Would you like to: [R]econsider, [B]reak down, [D]efer, [A]rchive?"

### Story 4.5: Goal Re-evaluation Prompts

As a user,
I want gentle prompts to reconsider goals when persistent avoidance patterns emerge,
So that my task list stays aligned with what I actually want to do.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
