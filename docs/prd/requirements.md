# Requirements

## Technical Demo & Validation Phase Requirements

**Core Requirements (Week 1 - Build & Validate):**

**TD1:** The system shall provide a CLI/TUI interface optimized for terminal emulators (iTerm2 and similar)

**TD2:** The system shall read tasks from a simple local text file (e.g., `~/.threedoors/tasks.txt`)

**TD3:** The system shall display the Three Doors interface showing three tasks selected from the text file

**TD4:** The system shall allow users to select a door using 'a' or 'left arrow' for the left door, 'w' or 'up arrow' for the center door, and 'd' or 'right arrow' for the right door. Initially, or after re-rolling, no door shall be selected.

**TD5:** The system shall provide a refresh mechanism using 's' or 'down arrow' to generate a new set of three doors.

**TD6:** The system shall display the three doors with dynamic width adjustment based on the terminal size.

**TD7:** The system shall respond to the following keystrokes for task management, with functionality to be implemented in future stories:
    *   'c': Mark selected task as complete.
    *   'b': Mark selected task as blocked.
    *   'i': Mark selected task as in progress.
    *   'e': Expand selected task (into more tasks).
    *   'f': Fork selected task (clone/split).
    *   'p': Procrastinate/avoid selected task.

**TD8:** The system shall display at least one "progress over perfection" encouragement message per session (e.g., on startup greeting or after completing a task)

**TD9:** The system shall write completed tasks to a separate file (e.g., `~/.threedoors/completed.txt`) with timestamp

**Success Criteria for Phase:**
- Built and running within 4-8 hours of development time
- Developer uses it daily for 1 week to validate UX concept
- Three Doors selection results in faster time-to-first-action compared to scanning a full task list (measured via session metrics)
- Decisions made on whether to proceed to Full MVP based on real usage

**FR6:** The system shall display user-defined values and goals persistently throughout task work sessions

**FR7:** The system shall provide a "choose-your-own-adventure" interactive navigation flow that presents options rather than demands

**FR8:** The system shall track daily task completion count and display comparison to previous day's count

**FR9:** The system shall prompt the user once per session with: "What's one thing you could improve about this list/task/goal right now?"

**FR10:** The system shall embed "progress over perfection" messaging throughout interaction patterns and interface copy (enhanced beyond Tech Demo)

**FR16:** The system shall support a "quick add" mode for capturing tasks in 3 or fewer keystrokes beyond typing the task text (e.g., `:add <text>` + Enter)

**FR18:** The system shall allow users to provide feedback on why a specific door isn't suitable with options: Blocked, Not now, Needs breakdown, or Other comment

**FR19:** The system shall capture and store blocker information when a task is marked as blocked

**FR20:** The system shall use door selection and feedback patterns to inform future door selection (learning which task types suit which contexts)

**FR21:** The system shall categorize tasks by type, effort level, and context to enable diverse door selection

**Phase 4 - Distribution & Packaging (macOS):**

**FR22:** The system shall provide macOS binaries that are code-signed with a valid Apple Developer certificate so that Gatekeeper does not quarantine the binary on download

**FR23:** The system shall be notarized with Apple's notarization service so that Gatekeeper allows execution without requiring users to bypass security warnings

**FR24:** The system shall be installable via Homebrew using a custom tap (`brew install arcaven/tap/threedoors`), with the formula downloading the appropriate signed binary for the user's architecture

**FR25:** The system shall provide a DMG or pkg installer as an alternative installation method for users who prefer graphical installation over Homebrew

**FR26:** The release process shall automate code signing, notarization, distribution formula updates, and installer generation without manual intervention

**Phase 5 - Data Layer & Enrichment:**

**FR11:** The system shall maintain a local enrichment layer for metadata, cross-references, and relationships that cannot be stored in source systems

---

## Code Quality & Submission Standards

These non-functional requirements establish code quality gates that all contributions must pass before submission. They are derived from recurring patterns identified across 31+ pull requests (see `docs/architecture/pr-submission-standards.md` for full rationale and evidence).

**NFR-CQ1:** All code must pass `gofumpt` formatting before submission — running `gofumpt -l .` must produce no output (Evidence: PRs #9, #10, #23, #24 required formatting fix-up commits)

**NFR-CQ2:** All code must pass `golangci-lint run ./...` with zero issues before submission, including `errcheck` and `staticcheck` analyzers (Evidence: PR #16 required 2 extra commits to resolve lint findings)

**NFR-CQ3:** All branches must be rebased onto `upstream/main` before PR creation — no merge commits, no stale branches (Evidence: PRs #3, #5, #19, #23 were delayed by merge conflicts from stale branches)

**NFR-CQ4:** All PRs must have a clean `git diff --stat` showing only in-scope changes — no unrelated files, no accidental directory additions (Evidence: PR #5 included an unrelated `agents/` directory)

**NFR-CQ5:** All fix-up commits must be squashed before PR submission — PRs should contain a single clean commit or logically separated commits, not iterative fix-up trails (Evidence: ~15 PRs contained avoidable "fix: address code review findings" commits)
