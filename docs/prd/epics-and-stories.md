**Prerequisites:** Epic 3 complete ✅, sufficient usage data collected
**FRs covered:** FR20, FR21
**Status:** COMPLETE — All 6 stories implemented and merged (PRs #40, #42-#45, #82).

### Story 4.1: Task Categorization & Tagging ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #40)

As a user,
I want my tasks automatically categorized by type, effort, and context,
So that the system can present diverse door selections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a task pool with uncategorized tasks
**When** the categorization engine processes them
**Then** each task receives type (creative, administrative, technical, physical), effort (quick-win, medium, deep-work), and context (home, work, errands) labels
**And** categorization is heuristic-based (keyword matching, task text analysis) without requiring user input
**And** users can override or correct auto-categorization via `:tag` command
**And** categories are persisted in task metadata (YAML)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.
**AC-Q8 (Determinism):** Categorization output must be deterministic for the same input; sorted collections where ordering matters.

### Story 4.2: Session Metrics Pattern Analysis ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #43)

As a developer,
I want to analyze historical session metrics for user behavior patterns,
So that the learning engine has data to work with.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** accumulated session metrics in sessions.jsonl

### Story 4.3: Mood-Aware Adaptive Door Selection ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #44)

As a user,
I want door selection to consider my current mood and historical patterns,
So that I'm shown tasks that match my current capacity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a user has logged a mood entry (or has recent mood history)
**When** doors are selected for display
**Then** the selection algorithm weights tasks based on mood-task correlation data (e.g., "stressed" → prefer quick-wins over deep-work)
**And** the algorithm still includes diversity (not all doors match mood preference)
**And** if no mood data exists, falls back to random selection (current behavior)
**And** selection weights are configurable in a learning config section

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.
**AC-Q8 (Determinism):** Adaptive selection must use seeded randomness or documented non-determinism; anti-repeat guards required; time.Now() called once per selection operation.

**Status:** Done (PR #45)

As a user,
I want to be gently informed about my avoidance patterns,
So that I can make conscious decisions about deferred tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a task has been shown in doors 5+ times without selection
**When** that task appears in doors again
**Then** a subtle indicator appears (e.g., "You've seen this task 7 times")
**And** the system does NOT nag or guilt — framing is informational
**And** a `:insights` command shows a summary of patterns ("When stressed, you avoid technical tasks")
**And** persistent avoidance (10+ bypasses) triggers a gentle prompt: "This task keeps appearing. Would you like to: [R]econsider, [B]reak down, [D]efer, [A]rchive?"

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.
**AC-Q8 (Determinism):** Avoidance counts must be deterministic; bypass tracking sorted by count; time.Now() called once per session.

### Story 4.5: Goal Re-evaluation Prompts ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #42)

As a user,
I want gentle prompts to reconsider goals when persistent avoidance patterns emerge,
So that my task list stays aligned with what I actually want to do.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a pattern of avoidance for tasks related to a specific goal/value
**When** avoidance exceeds threshold (configurable, default: 3 related tasks avoided 5+ times each)
**Then** at session start, a non-blocking prompt appears: "Some [goal] tasks have been deferred repeatedly. Would you like to review your [goal] priorities?"
**And** user can dismiss with a single keypress
**And** re-evaluation prompt shown at most once per week per goal
**And** prompt links to `:goals` command for editing

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

**Given** accumulated session history
**When** a new session starts
**Then** the greeting includes multi-dimensional comparison: tasks completed, doors opened, mood trend, avoidance reduction, and streaks
**And** comparison is day-over-day and week-over-week
**And** messaging is encouraging regardless of direction ("3 tasks today vs 5 yesterday — every door opened counts")
**And** dimensions are displayed compactly (single line or expandable)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.
**AC-Q8 (Determinism):** Multi-dimensional comparisons must use consistent time base; time.Now() called once per session start; streak calculations deterministic.

## Epic 18: Docker E2E & Headless TUI Testing Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Epic Goal:** Establish reproducible, automated end-to-end testing for the TUI application using Docker containers for environment isolation and Bubbletea's `teatest` package for headless interaction testing — eliminating manual TUI testing as the sole E2E validation method.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 3 ✅, Epic 9 (Stories 9.4, 9.5)
**FRs covered:** FR49, FR51 (extends Epic 9's scope with concrete implementation approach)
**Origin:** Party mode testing infrastructure discussion (2026-03-02). Party mode consensus identified two critical gaps: (1) no reproducible test environment — tests depend on developer machine state, and (2) TUI testing is entirely manual — 10% of the test pyramid has zero automation.
**Status:** COMPLETE — All 5 stories implemented and merged (PRs #64, #86, #105, #104, #107).

**Why a separate epic from Epic 9:** Epic 9 defines *what* to test (Apple Notes E2E, contract tests, performance benchmarks, functional E2E, CI gates). This epic defines *how* to test the TUI layer specifically — the Docker infrastructure and headless testing tooling that Epic 9 Story 9.4 depends on but doesn't specify.

### Story 18.1: Headless TUI Test Harness with teatest ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #64)

As a developer,
I want a headless TUI test harness using Bubbletea's `teatest` package,
So that I can write automated tests that interact with the full TUI without a real terminal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the `teatest` package (`github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest`) is added to `go.mod`
**When** a test creates a `teatest.NewTestModel` with the root TUI model
**Then** the test can send key messages (`tea.KeyMsg`) to simulate user input
**And** the test can retrieve `FinalOutput` and `FinalModel` for assertions
**And** `lipgloss.SetColorProfile(termenv.Ascii)` is enforced for deterministic output
**And** test helper `NewTestApp(t *testing.T, opts ...TestOption) *teatest.TestModel` is provided in `internal/tui/testhelpers_test.go`
**And** helper accepts options: `WithTermSize(w, h int)`, `WithTaskFile(path string)`, `WithConfig(cfg Config)`
**And** at least 3 smoke tests demonstrate the harness: app launch, door display, and quit
**And** tests use stdlib `testing` package only (no testify); table-driven for >2 cases; t.Helper() in helpers; t.Cleanup() for resources

**Technical Notes:**
- `teatest` creates a pseudo-TTY internally — no Docker needed for basic headless tests
- Fixed terminal size (`teatest.WithInitialTermSize(80, 24)`) ensures reproducible layout
- The harness wraps the existing `tui.NewModel()` constructor — no TUI code changes needed
- Test fixtures use `t.TempDir()` for task files and config

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

### Story 18.2: Golden File Snapshot Tests for TUI Views ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #86)

As a developer,
I want golden file tests that capture expected TUI output,
So that visual regressions in the Three Doors interface are caught automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the headless test harness from Story 18.1
**When** golden file tests run
**Then** `FinalOutput` is compared against `.golden` files in `internal/tui/testdata/`
**And** golden files cover: main doors view (3 tasks), empty state (0 tasks), too-few-tasks state (1-2 tasks), door selection highlight, status bar with values/goals, help overlay
**And** `.gitattributes` includes `*.golden -text` to prevent line-ending conversion
**And** golden files are regenerated via `go test ./internal/tui/... -update`
**And** CI runs golden file comparison (without `-update`) to catch regressions
**And** at least 6 golden file scenarios covering the views listed above

**Technical Notes:**
- Golden files are the teatest-recommended approach for View() output testing
- ASCII color profile ensures golden files are portable across terminals
- Golden file diffs in CI provide clear visual indication of what changed
- Keep golden files focused on layout structure, not exact styling (ASCII mode helps)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

### Story 18.3: Input Sequence Replay Tests for User Workflows ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #105)

As a developer,
I want automated tests that replay user input sequences against the TUI,
So that complete user workflows (launch → select → manage → exit) are validated end-to-end.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the headless test harness from Story 18.1
**When** workflow replay tests run
**Then** tests exercise these user journeys via `tm.Send(tea.KeyMsg{...})` sequences:
  1. Launch → view 3 doors → select door (A key) → verify selection
  2. Launch → re-roll doors (S key) → verify new doors displayed
  3. Launch → select door → complete task (C key) → verify task removed from pool
  4. Launch → select door → mark blocked (B key) → enter blocker text → verify
  5. Launch → quick add (N key) → type task → submit → verify task in pool
  6. Launch → open help (?) → verify help overlay → close help (Esc)
**And** each workflow asserts on `FinalModel` state (not just output text)
**And** workflows use `teatest.WaitFor` for intermediate state assertions where needed
**And** test task files are created via `t.TempDir()` with known task sets
**And** tests use stdlib `testing` package only; table-driven for workflow variants

**Technical Notes:**
- Input replays test the full Bubbletea Update() → View() cycle
- Model assertions are more stable than output assertions for workflow correctness
- `WaitFor` with timeout prevents tests from hanging on unexpected state
- Each workflow should complete in <2s (set `teatest.WithFinalTimeout(2*time.Second)`)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

### Story 18.4: Docker Test Environment for Reproducible E2E ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #104)

As a developer,
I want a Docker-based test environment,
So that E2E tests run identically on any machine and in CI regardless of host OS or installed tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a `Dockerfile.test` in the repository root
**When** `make test-docker` is run
**Then** a Docker image is built with: Go toolchain, gofumpt, golangci-lint, and all test dependencies
**And** the full test suite (`go test ./... -v -count=1`) runs inside the container
**And** golden file tests and workflow replay tests from Stories 18.2-18.3 pass inside Docker
**And** test results and coverage report are written to a mounted volume (`./test-results/`)
**And** `docker-compose.test.yml` defines the test service with: build context, volume mounts for source and results, environment variables for test configuration
**And** the container uses a non-root user for test execution
**And** image build time is <2 minutes on a cold build (use multi-stage build with cached Go modules)
**And** `make test-docker` exits with the same exit code as the test suite

**Technical Notes:**
- Multi-stage Dockerfile: stage 1 installs tools + caches `go mod download`, stage 2 copies source and runs tests
- Docker provides the pseudo-TTY that teatest needs — no special terminal setup required
- Volume mount for source code enables fast iteration without rebuilding the image
- CI can use the same Docker image, ensuring dev/CI environment parity
- No macOS-specific dependencies in Docker (Apple Notes tests are excluded via build tags)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

### Story 18.5: CI Integration for Docker E2E Tests ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #107)

As the team,
I want Docker E2E tests running automatically in CI,
So that TUI regressions are caught on every PR without relying on manual testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Docker test environment from Story 18.4
**When** a PR is submitted
**Then** a new CI job `test-docker-e2e` runs the Docker test suite
**And** the job uses `docker-compose.test.yml` to run tests
**And** test results are uploaded as CI artifacts
**And** golden file diffs (if any) are included in the CI output for review
**And** the job runs in parallel with existing `quality-gate` and `build` jobs
**And** the job completes in <5 minutes (Docker layer caching via GitHub Actions cache)
**And** the job fails the PR check if any E2E test fails
**And** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is updated with the new job

**Technical Notes:**
- GitHub Actions supports Docker natively — use `docker compose run` in a step
- Cache Docker layers via `actions/cache` with `docker buildx` for fast rebuilds
- Separate job (not step) allows parallel execution with existing quality gates
- Apple Notes integration tests remain macOS-only; Docker E2E covers everything else

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓ | See Appendix for full BDD criteria and pre-PR checklist.

## Appendix: PR-Analysis-Derived Quality Acceptance Criteria

> **Source:** Systematic analysis of all 49 PRs (#1–#49) in arcaven/ThreeDoors, examining every delta between initial PR submission and final merge. These ACs are derived from recurring defect patterns and MUST be included in all future stories.

### Issue Categorization Summary

Analysis of 49 PRs found 18 PRs (37%) required post-submission changes. The remaining 31 PRs (63%) merged cleanly on first submission. Issue breakdown by category:

| **Logic/correctness bugs** | #14, #17, #18, #19, #44 | 16% | Insufficient edge-case thinking in ACs |
| **Merge conflicts** | #3, #5, #19, #23, #42 | 16% | Stale branches, no pre-PR rebase |
| **gofumpt formatting** | #9, #23, #24, #42 | 13% | Formatter not run before push |
| **Missing test coverage** | #5, #7, #16, #20 | 13% | No coverage gate in story ACs |
| **Silently ignored errors** | #16, #17 | 6% | No errcheck enforcement in ACs |
| **Duplicate/wasted work** | #14, #49 | 6% | Parallel agents implementing same story |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | #17 | 3% | No input sanitization AC |
| **Scope creep** | #5 | 3% | No scope-limiting AC |

### Mandatory Quality ACs for All Future Stories

Every story in Epics 3.5–18 MUST include the following acceptance criteria in addition to feature-specific ACs. These are NON-NEGOTIABLE and derived from empirical PR failure data. Each story references these gates via a compact **Quality Gate** line; this appendix provides the authoritative BDD definitions.

#### AC-Q1: Formatting Gate (PRs #9, #23, #24, #42)

```
GIVEN code changes are ready for PR
WHEN `gofumpt -l .` is executed from the repository root
THEN zero files are listed (all files are properly formatted)
```

#### AC-Q2: Full Lint Gate (PRs #16, #42, #43, #44, #45)

```
GIVEN code changes are ready for PR
WHEN `golangci-lint run ./...` is executed
THEN zero issues are reported
AND specifically: no errcheck violations (all error return values checked, including f.Close(), os.Remove(), os.WriteFile())
AND specifically: no staticcheck QF1012 violations (never use WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(...)), always use fmt.Fprintf())
AND specifically: no staticcheck S1009 violations (no redundant nil checks before len())
AND specifically: no staticcheck S1011 violations (use append(slice, other...) not loops)
```

#### AC-Q3: Test Coverage Gate (PRs #5, #7, #16, #20)

```
GIVEN code changes are ready for PR
WHEN `go test ./...` is executed
THEN all tests pass
AND new code paths have corresponding test cases
AND no existing test files are deleted without equivalent replacement coverage
AND test assertions verify actual outcomes (not just "no error")
```

#### AC-Q4: Rebase Gate (PRs #3, #5, #19, #23, #42)

```
GIVEN code changes are ready for PR
WHEN the branch is compared against upstream/main
THEN the branch is rebased onto the latest upstream/main with zero conflicts
AND `gofumpt -l .` still produces zero output after rebase (rebase can introduce formatting drift)
```

#### AC-Q5: Scope Gate (PR #5)

```
GIVEN code changes are ready for PR
WHEN `git diff --stat` is reviewed
THEN all changed files are directly related to the story's acceptance criteria
AND no unrelated directories or configuration files are included
```

#### AC-Q6: Input Sanitization Gate (PR #17)

```
GIVEN the story involves constructing dynamic commands, scripts, or queries (AppleScript, SQL, shell, etc.)
WHEN user-provided or external data is interpolated into the command
THEN all interpolated values are properly escaped/sanitized for the target language
AND injection test cases are included for special characters (quotes, backslashes, semicolons)
```

#### AC-Q7: Error Handling Gate (PRs #16, #17)

```
GIVEN code changes include function calls that return errors
WHEN reviewing the code diff
THEN no error return values are silently discarded (assigned to `_` or ignored)
AND deferred Close() calls on writable files use error-checking patterns
AND error messages include context via fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err) wrapping
```

#### AC-Q8: Determinism Gate (PRs #14, #18)

```
GIVEN code changes involve ordering, randomization, or time-dependent behavior
WHEN the same inputs are provided
THEN outputs are deterministic (sorted collections, seeded randomness, or documented non-determinism)
AND randomized outputs have anti-repeat guards (no consecutive identical selections)
AND time.Now() is called once per logical operation, not inside loops
```

### Per-Story Defect Tracing

The following maps each affected story to the specific PR issues it produced:

| Story | PR(s) | Issues Found | Missing AC That Would Have Prevented It |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | #2 | 26 latent lint issues (discovered in PR #8) | AC-Q2 (lint gate) |
| 1.2 | #4 | Latent lint issues | AC-Q2 (lint gate) |
| 1.3 | #3→#5, #7 | Out-of-order impl, merge conflicts, deleted 324 test lines, scope creep (agents/ dir) | AC-Q3 (test gate), AC-Q4 (rebase gate), AC-Q5 (scope gate) |

## Epic 22: Self-Driving Development Pipeline ✅ COMPLETE

**Epic Goal:** Enable ThreeDoors tasks to directly trigger multiclaude worker agents, creating a closed loop where the app dispatches its own development work and tracks results (PRs, CI status) back in the TUI. This is the "meta" feature: ThreeDoors managing its own development.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 14 ✅ (LLM Decomposition — provides AgentService for optional story generation), multiclaude installed and configured
**FRs covered:** FR73, FR74, FR75, FR76, FR77, FR78, FR79, FR80
**NFRs covered:** NFR24, NFR25, NFR26, NFR27
**Origin:** Self-driving development pipeline research (2026-03-04). Research document at `docs/research/self-driving-development-pipeline.md`.
**Architecture:** Option B (TUI-Native Dispatch) — single-process, unified UX, leverages existing multiclaude CLI and Bubbletea patterns.
**Status:** COMPLETE — All 8 stories implemented and merged (PRs #149, #152, #163, #162, #161, #164, #159, #160).

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Dispatch state (`DevDispatch`) is orthogonal to task lifecycle status — a task can be `in-progress` AND dispatched
- File-based queue (`~/.threedoors/dev-queue.yaml`) — consistent with YAML data model, offline-capable, inspectable
- 30-second `tea.Tick` polling via `multiclaude repo history` — simple, reliable, matches Bubbletea patterns
- Feature gated behind `dev_dispatch_enabled: true` in config — disabled by default
- No auto-dispatch by default — user must explicitly approve each dispatch
- Max 2 concurrent workers — conservative default to prevent cost runaway

### Story 22.1: Dev Dispatch Data Model and Queue Persistence ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #149)

As a developer,
I want a `DevDispatch` struct on the `Task` type and a file-based dev queue,
So that dispatch state is tracked independently from task lifecycle and persists across TUI restarts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the need to track dev dispatch state orthogonal to task status
**When** the data model is created
**Then:**
- AC1: `DevDispatch` struct defined in `internal/dispatch/model.go` with fields: Queued (`bool`), QueuedAt (`*time.Time`), WorkerName (`string`), PRNumber (`int`), PRStatus (`string`), DispatchErr (`string`)
- AC2: `QueueItem` struct defined with fields: ID, TaskID, TaskText, Context, Status (pending/dispatched/completed/failed), Priority, Scope, AcceptanceCriteria, QueuedAt, DispatchedAt, CompletedAt, WorkerName, PRNumber, PRURL, Error
- AC3: `DevQueue` struct with `Load(path string) error`, `Save(path string) error`, `Add(item QueueItem) error`, `Get(id string) (QueueItem, error)`, `Update(id string, fn func(*QueueItem)) error`, `List() []QueueItem`
- AC4: Queue file location defaults to `~/.threedoors/dev-queue.yaml`
- AC5: Queue persistence uses atomic write pattern (write to `.tmp`, sync, rename)
- AC6: `Task` struct in `internal/core/task.go` extended with `DevDispatch *DevDispatch` field (pointer, omitempty)
- AC7: Unit tests for queue CRUD operations and atomic write safety

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.2: Dispatch Engine with multiclaude CLI Wrapper ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #152)

As a developer,
I want a dispatch engine that wraps the multiclaude CLI,
So that ThreeDoors can create workers, list workers, get history, and remove workers programmatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the need to interact with multiclaude from within ThreeDoors
**When** the dispatch engine is implemented
**Then:**
- AC1: `Dispatcher` interface defined in `internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go` with methods: `CreateWorker(ctx, task string) (workerName string, err error)`, `ListWorkers(ctx) ([]WorkerInfo, error)`, `GetHistory(ctx, limit int) ([]HistoryEntry, error)`, `RemoveWorker(ctx, name string) error`
- AC2: `CLIDispatcher` concrete implementation wraps `os/exec` calls to `multiclaude` CLI
- AC3: `CommandRunner` interface for testability (mock subprocess execution)
- AC4: Task-to-worker translation builds rich prompt from task text, context, acceptance criteria, scope, and standard suffix (signing, fork workflow)
- AC5: `CheckAvailable(ctx) error` method validates `multiclaude` is on PATH
- AC6: Unit tests with mock `CommandRunner` for all dispatch operations
- AC7: Error wrapping follows `fmt.Errorf("dispatch %s: %w", op, err)` pattern

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.3: TUI Dispatch Key Binding and Confirmation Flow ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #163)

As a user,
I want to press 'x' in the task detail view or type `:dispatch` to dispatch a task to the dev queue,
So that I can trigger automated development work on a selected task.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a task is selected in the detail view and dev dispatch is enabled
**When** the user presses 'x' or types `:dispatch`
**Then:**
- AC1: Confirmation dialog appears: "Dispatch '<task text>' to dev queue? [y/n]"
- AC2: On 'y', task is added to dev queue with status `pending` and `Task.DevDispatch.Queued` set to `true`
- AC3: On 'n', confirmation is dismissed with no side effects
- AC4: If task is already dispatched, show message "Task already dispatched" and do not re-enqueue
- AC5: If multiclaude is not available, 'x' key and `:dispatch` command are hidden/disabled with message "multiclaude not found — dev dispatch unavailable"
- AC6: If `dev_dispatch_enabled` is `false` in config, 'x' key and `:dispatch` are not registered
- AC7: `[DEV]` badge appears on dispatched tasks in the doors view

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.4: Dev Queue View (List, Approve, Kill) ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #162)

As a user,
I want a dev queue view where I can see pending dispatches, approve them, and kill running workers,
So that I maintain control over what gets dispatched and can stop runaway agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the user opens the dev queue view via `:devqueue` command
**When** the view renders
**Then:**
- AC1: Queue items displayed as a list with columns: Status (icon), Task Text (truncated), Worker Name, PR #, Queued At
- AC2: 'y' key approves a pending item (triggers `multiclaude worker create`)
- AC3: 'n' key rejects a pending item (removes from queue)
- AC4: 'K' key kills a dispatched/running worker (`multiclaude worker rm`)
- AC5: 'j'/'k' or arrow keys navigate the list
- AC6: ESC returns to the doors view
- AC7: Status icons: ⏳ pending, ⚙️ dispatched, ✅ completed, ❌ failed
- AC8: View auto-refreshes on 30-second tick (same as worker status polling)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.5: Worker Status Polling and Task Update Loop ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #161)

As a user,
I want ThreeDoors to automatically check on worker status and update tasks with PR results,
So that I can see development progress without leaving the TUI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** one or more queue items are in `dispatched` status
**When** the 30-second tick fires
**Then:**
- AC1: `tea.Tick` command fires every 30 seconds while any queue items are in `dispatched` status
- AC2: Tick runs `multiclaude repo history` via the dispatch engine and parses output
- AC3: Worker name matched to queue item; status updated (dispatched → completed/failed)
- AC4: PR number and URL extracted and set on queue item and `Task.DevDispatch`
- AC5: Task badge in doors view updates to show PR status (e.g., `[PR #134]`)
- AC6: Polling stops when no items are in `dispatched` status (no unnecessary ticks)
- AC7: Parse errors logged but do not crash the TUI — Bubbletea `Update()` must never panic

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.6: Auto-Generated Review and Follow-Up Tasks ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #164)

As a user,
I want ThreeDoors to automatically create review and follow-up tasks when workers produce results,
So that PR reviews and CI fixes appear naturally in my door rotation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a worker has completed and a PR has been created
**When** the polling loop detects the completion
**Then:**
- AC1: New task created: "Review PR #N: <original task text>" with status `todo`
- AC2: If CI fails on the PR, new task created: "Fix CI on PR #N: <failure summary>" with status `todo`
- AC3: Generated tasks appear in normal door rotation
- AC4: Generated tasks reference the original task ID in their context field
- AC5: No duplicate tasks generated — if "Review PR #N" already exists, skip creation
- AC6: Auto-generated tasks have `DevDispatch.PRNumber` pre-set for traceability

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.7: Optional Story File Generation via AgentService ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #159)

As a user,
I want to optionally generate story files before dispatching a task,
So that workers receive structured requirements following the project's story-driven development pattern.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** `require_story: true` is set in dev queue settings
**When** a task is dispatched
**Then:**
- AC1: `AgentService.DecomposeAndWrite()` is called to generate BMAD-style story files from the task
- AC2: Story files are committed to a branch before the worker is spawned
- AC3: Worker task description includes instructions to implement the generated stories
- AC4: If `require_story: false`, story generation is skipped and the worker receives the raw task description
- AC5: Story generation failure is non-fatal — logs error, proceeds with raw task dispatch, sets warning on queue item
- AC6: Configuration option `require_story` defaults to `false`

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 22.8: Safety Guardrails (Rate Limiting, Cost Caps, Audit Log) ✅

**Status:** Done (PR #160)

As a user,
I want safety guardrails preventing runaway agent spawning and providing an audit trail,
So that I can use the self-driving pipeline without risk of excessive cost or uncontrolled automation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the dispatch engine is operational
**When** guardrails are configured
**Then:**
- AC1: Max concurrent workers enforced (default 2) — dispatch refused with message if at capacity
- AC2: Manual approval gate by default (`auto_dispatch: false`) — pending items require explicit 'y' in dev queue view
- AC3: Minimum 5-minute cooldown between dispatches to the same task
- AC4: Daily dispatch limit enforced (default 10) — dispatch refused with message if exceeded
- AC5: Every dispatch, completion, and failure logged to `~/.threedoors/dev-dispatch.log` in JSONL format
- AC6: `:dispatch --dry-run` shows the full multiclaude command without executing
- AC7: Guardrail settings configurable in `~/.threedoors/config.yaml` under `dev_dispatch` section
- AC8: All guardrail violations produce user-visible messages in the TUI (not silent failures)

**Quality Gate (AC-Q1–Q8):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

## Epic 24: MCP/LLM Integration Server

**Epic Goal:** Expose ThreeDoors task management services to LLMs through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). LLMs can query tasks, propose enrichments (with user approval), mine productivity analytics, and traverse task relationship graphs across providers. Core design principle: LLMs propose, users approve — no direct task modification.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 13 ✅ (Multi-Source Aggregation), Epic 6 ✅ (Enrichment DB)
**FRs covered:** FR81, FR82, FR83, FR84, FR85, FR86, FR87, FR88
**Origin:** LLM Integration & MCP Server Research (2026-03-06). Research document at `docs/research/llm-integration-mcp.md`.
**Architecture:** Separate binary (`cmd/threedoors-mcp/`) sharing `internal/` packages. No new storage layer — reads same YAML, JSONL, and SQLite as TUI.
**Status:** Not Started

**Key Design Decisions:**
- MCP server is a separate binary from the TUI — independently deployable
- LLMs NEVER directly edit task data — all modifications flow through proposal/approval pattern
- No new storage layer — MCP server reads from the same files as the TUI
- Proposal store is append-only JSONL (`~/.threedoors/proposals.jsonl`)
- Server supports stdio (Claude Desktop) and SSE (remote) transports
- Security: rate limiting, audit logging with SHA-256 hash chain, input validation, read-only enforcement

### Story 24.1: MCP Server Binary & Transport Layer

**Status:** draft

As a developer,
I want a standalone MCP server binary that implements the MCP protocol over stdio and SSE transports,
So that LLM clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) can connect to ThreeDoors and discover available capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** `cmd/threedoors-mcp/main.go` entry point with `MCPServer` wrapping existing core components
- **AC2:** MCP JSON-RPC protocol handlers: `initialize`, `resources/list`, `tools/list`, `prompts/list`
- **AC3:** stdio transport (default) for Claude Desktop integration
- **AC4:** SSE transport (`--transport sse --port 8080`) for remote access
- **AC5:** `MCPMiddleware` type as `func(Handler) Handler` decorator pattern
- **AC6:** `Makefile` updated with `build-mcp` target
- **AC7:** Unit tests for protocol handshake and transport selection

**Quality Gate (QG1-QG6):** gofumpt ✓ | golangci-lint ✓ | tests pass ✓ | rebased ✓ | scope-checked ✓ | errors handled ✓

### Story 24.2: Read-Only Task Resources & Query Tools

**Status:** draft

As an LLM client connected via MCP,
I want to read task data, query tasks with filters, and inspect provider health,
So that I can understand the user's task landscape and answer questions about their work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** MCP Resources: `threedoors://tasks`, `threedoors://tasks/{id}`, `threedoors://tasks/status/{status}`, `threedoors://tasks/provider/{name}`
- **AC2:** MCP Resources: `threedoors://providers`, `threedoors://session/current`, `threedoors://session/history`
- **AC3:** MCP Tool `query_tasks` with filters: status, type, effort, provider, text, dates, limit, sort
- **AC4:** MCP Tools: `get_task`, `list_providers`, `get_session`
- **AC5:** Response metadata on all queries: `total_count`, `returned_count`, `query_time_ms`, `providers_queried`, `data_freshness`
- **AC6:** `TaskQueryEngine` with text search, token overlap scoring, field weighting, recency boost
- **AC7:** Unit tests for all resources, tools, and query engine

### Story 24.3: Security Middleware — Rate Limiting & Audit Logging

**Status:** draft

As a system administrator,
I want the MCP server to enforce rate limits, log all requests, and validate inputs,
So that the server is protected against abuse and maintains a tamper-evident audit trail.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** `RateLimiter`: 100 req/min global, 20 proposals/min, 60 queries/min, 5 pending proposals/task, 10-request burst
- **AC2:** `AuditLogger`: JSONL to `~/.threedoors/mcp-audit.jsonl` with SHA-256 hash chain
- **AC3:** `SchemaValidator`: UUID v4 task IDs, 500-char text limit, valid status/timestamps
- **AC4:** `ReadOnlyEnforcer`: blocks direct `SaveTask()` calls
- **AC5:** Middleware chain: ReadOnlyEnforcer → RateLimiter → AuditLogger → SchemaValidator → coreHandler
- **AC6:** Daily log rotation with 30-day retention
- **AC7:** Unit tests for each middleware and composed chain

### Story 24.4: Proposal Store & Controlled Enrichment API

**Status:** draft

As an LLM client,
I want to propose task enrichments through a controlled API,
So that I can suggest improvements without directly modifying task data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** `Proposal` struct with ID, Type, TaskID, BaseVersion, Payload, Status, Source, Rationale, timestamps
- **AC2:** 8 proposal types: enrich-metadata, add-subtasks, add-context, add-note, suggest-blocker, suggest-relationship, suggest-category, update-effort
- **AC3:** `ProposalStore` with append-only JSONL persistence
- **AC4:** Optimistic concurrency: BaseVersion vs current UpdatedAt — stale detection
- **AC5:** MCP Tools: `propose_enrichment`, `suggest_task`, `suggest_relationship`
- **AC6:** MCP Resource: `threedoors://proposals/pending`
- **AC7:** Deduplication, per-task caps (5), 7-day expiration
- **AC8:** `IntakeChannel` interface for extensible intake sources

### Story 24.5: TUI Proposal Review View

**Status:** draft

As a user,
I want to review, approve, and reject LLM-generated proposals from within the TUI,
So that I maintain full control over what changes are applied to my tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** Badge indicator on doors view: `[3 suggestions]`
- **AC2:** Review view via `S` key or `:suggestions` command — split pane layout
- **AC3:** Quick actions: Enter=approve, Backspace=reject, Tab=skip, Ctrl+A=approve all
- **AC4:** On approve: payload applied to task via `SaveTask()`, enrichment DB updated
- **AC5:** Stale proposals visually distinguished with tooltip
- **AC6:** Preview mode showing task diff before/after
- **AC7:** Batch grouping by task, j/k navigation, ESC to exit

## Epic 23: CLI Interface

**Epic Goal:** Provide a complete non-TUI CLI interface for ThreeDoors that serves both human power users (scriptable task management) and LLM agents (structured JSON output). The CLI shares `internal/core` with the TUI — no domain logic duplication. `threedoors` with no args launches the TUI (backward compatible); any subcommand routes to the Cobra-based CLI.

**Prerequisites:** None (core domain layer is already CLI-ready with JSON struct tags)
**Framework:** Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`) for subcommand routing, shell completions, and help generation
**Origin:** CLI interface design research (`docs/research/cli-interface-design.md`)
**Architecture:** Layered CLI/TUI coexistence — `internal/cli/` imports `internal/core/`, never `internal/tui/`
**Status:** Not Started

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Noun-verb command taxonomy: `threedoors task <verb>` (modeled after `gh` CLI)
- `--json` persistent flag switches all output from human-readable to structured JSON
- JSON envelope with `schema_version: 1` for forward compatibility
- Exit codes 0-5 for machine-parseable error handling
- ID prefix matching for human-friendly task references (like git short SHAs)
- Non-interactive by default — CLI prints and exits, `--interactive` opt-in
- `threedoors doors` is the signature CLI command (equivalent of TUI launch)

### Story 23.1: Cobra Scaffolding, Root Command, and Output Formatter

**Status:** Draft

As a developer,
I want a Cobra-based CLI scaffold with a root command, `--json` persistent flag, and a shared output formatter,
So that all subsequent CLI commands have a consistent foundation for routing, output formatting, and error handling.

**Given** the need for a CLI interface alongside the existing TUI
**When** the scaffolding is implemented
**Then:**
- AC1: `internal/cli/root.go` defines the Cobra root command with `--json` persistent flag
- AC2: `internal/cli/output.go` defines an `OutputFormatter` supporting human-readable (tabwriter) and JSON modes
- AC3: JSON output uses envelope: `{"schema_version": 1, "command": "<cmd>", "data": ..., "metadata": {...}}`
- AC4: `cmd/threedoors/main.go` updated with subcommand detection — backward compatible TUI launch
- AC5: `go.mod` updated with Cobra dependency
