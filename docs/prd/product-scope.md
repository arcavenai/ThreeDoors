# Product Scope

## Phase 1: Technical Demo & Validation (MVP)

**In Scope:**
- CLI/TUI application using Go and Bubbletea framework
- Three Doors interface displaying three randomly selected tasks
- Local text file storage (`~/.threedoors/tasks.txt`)
- Door selection via keyboard (A/W/D, arrow keys)
- Door refresh to generate new set of three tasks
- Expanded task detail view with status actions
- Task status management: complete, blocked, in progress, expand, fork, procrastinate, rework
- Quick search with live substring matching (/ key)
- Command palette with vi-style `:commands` (`:add`, `:edit`, `:mood`, `:stats`, `:help`, `:quit`)
- Mood tracking with predefined and custom options
- Silent session metrics collection (JSONL format)
- Completed task tracking with timestamps
- "Progress over perfection" messaging in interface
- macOS as primary target platform

**Out of Scope for Phase 1:**
- Apple Notes integration
- Bidirectional sync with any external system
- LLM-powered features
- Values/goals persistent display
- Automated tests (manual validation via daily use)
- Cross-computer sync
- Mobile interface
- Any cloud services or telemetry

---

## Phase 2: Growth (Post-Validation)

**In Scope:**
- Apple Notes integration with bidirectional sync
- Adapter pattern for pluggable backends
- Quick add mode and extended task capture with context
- Values/goals setup and persistent display
- Door feedback mechanisms (blocked, not now, needs breakdown)
- Learning and intelligent door selection based on session metrics
- macOS code signing, notarization, and Homebrew distribution
- Local enrichment storage (SQLite) for metadata
- Health check command for backend connectivity

- Door theme system with user-selectable themed door frames (onboarding picker, settings view, config.yaml)
- Platform readiness refactoring: core domain extraction, adapter hardening, config schema, regression test suite, session metrics reader, CI coverage floor (Epic 3.5)

**Out of Scope for Phase 2:**
- Third-party integrations beyond Apple Notes
- Cross-computer sync
- LLM task decomposition
- Calendar awareness
- Multi-source aggregation

---

## Phase 3: Vision (Post-MVP)

**In Scope:**
- Plugin/adapter SDK with registry and developer guide
- Obsidian vault integration
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (integration, contract, E2E, CI gates)
- First-run onboarding experience
- Sync observability and offline-first operation
- Calendar awareness (local-first, no OAuth)
- Multi-source task aggregation with dedup
- LLM-powered task decomposition
- Psychology research validation
- Docker-based E2E and headless TUI testing infrastructure (teatest, golden file snapshots, workflow replay, CI integration)

**Out of Scope (Deferred Indefinitely):**
- Web interface
- Voice interface
- Gamification and trading mechanics
- Multi-user support

---

## Phase 4: Task Source Integration & Sync Hardening

**In Scope:**
- Jira integration: read-only adapter (JQL search, status mapping, auth config), then bidirectional sync (MarkComplete via transitions API, WAL queuing)
- Apple Reminders integration: JXA-based adapter with full CRUD (read, create, update, complete, delete), configurable list filtering
- Sync protocol hardening: per-provider sync scheduler with adaptive intervals, circuit breaker per provider, canonical ID mapping via SourceRef
- Generic adapter patterns: rate limit handling, local cache with TTL, credential management via config.yaml/env vars

**Out of Scope for Phase 4:**
- Todoist, Linear, GitHub Issues, ClickUp integrations (deferred to Phase 5+)
- OAuth 2.0 flows (API token/PAT auth only for initial integrations)
- EventKit/cgo-based Apple Reminders (future optimization behind build tag)
- Property-level conflict resolution (deferred to Phase 5)
- Cross-computer sync

---

## Phase 5: Future Expansion (12+ months out)

**In Scope:**
- iPhone mobile app (SwiftUI) with Apple Notes sync and Three Doors card carousel
- Self-driving development pipeline (multiclaude worker dispatch from TUI)
- Additional integrations (Todoist, Linear, GitHub Issues, ClickUp)
- Cross-computer sync

**Out of Scope (Deferred Indefinitely):**
- iPad app
- Apple Watch app
- Android app
- Multi-user support
- Web interface
- Voice interface
